# Backup Script for WordPress with Telegram Notifications

This script automates the backup process for a WordPress site, including database and theme files. It compresses the backups and sends them to Telegram using a Cloudflare Worker proxy for API requests.

---

## Features

- Automated backup for WordPress database and theme files
- Compresses backups for efficient storage
- Sends backup files to Telegram via a proxy to bypass restrictions
- Logs all operations for monitoring and debugging
- Splits large files to comply with Telegram's 50MB file limit
- Sends start/completion notifications with detailed metadata

---

## Requirements

### 1. Server Environment
- Linux-based server (Ubuntu/CentOS recommended)
- Bash shell

### 2. Required Tools
- `curl`: For sending requests to Telegram
- `jq`: For parsing JSON responses
- `tar`: For file compression
- `split`: To handle Telegram's file size limits

Install dependencies:
```bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install curl jq tar -y

bash```
3. Telegram Setup
Create a bot via BotFather

Get your BOT_TOKEN from BotFather

Get your CHAT_ID using @userinfobot or group management bots

4. Cloudflare Worker Proxy

Error Handling
Common Issues & Solutions
Database Connection Failed:

log
mysqldump: Got error: 1045: Access denied for user...
Verify DB credentials

Check MySQL user privileges

Test connection manually:

bash
mysql -u [user] -p[password] -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
File Permission Errors:

log
tar: wp-content/themes: Cannot open: Permission denied
Ensure script has read access:

bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www
Telegram API Errors:

log
{"ok":false,"error_code":400,"description":"Bad Request: chat not found"}
Verify CHAT_ID is correct

Check bot was added to the group/channel

Test proxy connectivity:

bash
curl -I $PROXY_URL
File Size Too Large:

log
Request Entity Too Large
Reduce CHUNK_SIZE to 45M if needed

Verify split command is working

Advanced Customization
1. Adjust File Size Limit
Modify chunk size in the script:

bash
CHUNK_SIZE=45M  # For stricter networks
2. Include Additional Directories
Add more directories to backup by modifying the theme backup section:

bash
# Backup both themes and plugins
tar -czf "$THEME_ARCHIVE" -C "$WEB_ROOT/wp-content" themes/ plugins/
3. Cron Job Automation
Schedule daily backups at 2 AM:

bash
crontab -e
Add:

bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup-with-param.sh \
    "My Site" \
    db_name \
    db_user \
    db_pass \
    /var/www/mysite.com/htdocs
4. Retention Policy
Add this to the end of the script to keep backups for 7 days:

bash
# Cleanup old backups
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "${SITE_NAME}_*" -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;
5. Email Notifications
Add email alerts on failure (requires mailutils):

bash
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup failed for $SITE_NAME" | mail -s "Backup Failure" admin@example.com
fi
